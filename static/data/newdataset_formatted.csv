0:00:00;0:01:00;Tyler; Yeah, full detail with everyone here.  So, um, you guys, I'll just do introductions, again.  Um, you guys have met me.  I'm Tyler.  Um, I have worked here, and I do the recruits department.  Um, I also do some property management stuff for our south campus, um, I'm on call for emergencies and working with maintenance and stuff like that.  Um, this Daniel and Janice from Champ Camp . Um, so they're a big part of, ah, putting the zip lines up and the tree house idea and kind of a driving force behind that.  Um, and then this is Matt, ah, one of the landscape architects from IU.  Um, he helps us from the IU standpoint in terms of, um, safety procedures, things like that if people fall, and making good decisions on landscape. I don't have a whole lot else to say.  Um, you know, I can kinda facilitate conversation a little bit, but it sounds like, you know, we have some, some vision sharing that can be done and probably a lot of questions from you guys.  Ah, we can meet here.  Um, we could-
0:01:00;0:02:00;Tyler; also walk over to the site, um, and take a look at things over there.  I know you guys have already been over there, so maybe you guys will want to go back over and, and talk about some things with them.  So is that enough introduction for you guys?  Can you take it and, and run with it?
0:01:00;0:02:00;Catherine; Yes we take it and run with it.
0:01:00;0:02:00;Tyler; All right.  I'm gonna hang out.
0:01:00;0:02:00;Catherine; So I think one of the things we want to hear kind of your vision for the tree house.  Um, we have ideas about the other day just kind of first hear what that vision is with everybody.
0:01:00;0:02:00;Daniel; [Clears throat] Let me just kinda give you a little background of how we came to be.  Um, and it's unfortunate you weren't able to come when, when our camp runs in the latter part of June.  The kids you've been working with today or the last couple days, are, are very, um, the kind of campers that need these types of experiences Champ Camp takes that to another level because the-
0:02:00;0:03:00;Daniel; kids who come to Champ Camp require a lot more, ah, technological need maybe a wheelchair.  So maybe indoor require ventilator assistance at nighttime.  So these are typically kids that are not allowed to go to any other kinds of camps because of their medical condition.  And as we came back to Bradford Woods  three years ago and then Ohio for 20 years, um, camps who can incorporate what Champ Camp brings to the table, we can handle the kind of kids we bring into our camp, and we see a facility can handle any type of camper just because of the physical demands of the environment, um, and then the physical demand to the camper.  From an equipment perspective, it's [unintelligible] perspective.  Um, i-, it is oftentimes that Champ Camp built new - established types of programs who want to do through the eyes of campers.  Kids that you work - have seen today, this is - I've seen wheelchairs what there is what they see.  While you have-
0:03:00;0:04:00;Daniel; some kids who are ambulatory, but a lot of the kids who are in wheelchairs their life's vision is from about four feet - about four-foot level.  Anything above that is outside of their normal element.  We try to bring those elements to them, and we try to do that at Champ Camp as well.  So we incorporate programming to the extreme, and that is what can we provide, ah, visibly challenged population of campers from adolescence, from child adolescence up to adults that they wouldn't typically be able to do.  And we've pushed the limits from, um, initially, um, there's - we, we get [tree to tree climb] which are tree that had ropes that we could, we can send up, ah, to all up to 25-foot high.  These kids have never had the ability to be up in a tree.  Um, one confined to a wheelchair.  A lot of the times, since these kids when you ask them whether they wanna do things inside or outside, more times than not, they're gonna say they wanna do things outside because they're [life is incorporated in] inside.
0:04:00;0:05:00;Daniel; And that's their life.  So we want it to be different.  Um, so when we talk to kids at camp, our camp, about what they want, um what they hope to do.  They want to push beyond the limit [unintelligible] [group of people walk through].
0:04:00;0:05:00;Female; Sorry, guys.
0:04:00;0:05:00;Daniel; Um, swimming another example with canoeing, um, canoes that are not tippable, and so [unintelligible] out on the lake, you've seen the pontoons and outriggers. These were designed, um, kind of conceptually about what and how I want it to be and then we've created those.  So literally, those canoes will not tip over.  So I can put kids who are on ventilators in that canoe without the fear of them tipping.  Um, and that gives them an experience [they're missing] -
0:04:00;0:05:00;Female; [Yelling in background] Ryan, Ryan.
0:04:00;0:05:00;Daniel; For a long time [group of people walk through] we've talked about how we inco- 
0:05:00;0:06:00;Daniel; how can we incorporate a zip line into camp activities.  And if we were gonna do that, how could we incorporate more activities.  So through some work with another camp out in Adirondack, ah, how to make, uh zip line adaptable for campers who are in wheelchairs or [rigid], um, we've found a way to do it and work with the company that makes adaptive ski chairs out in Denver to create a chair that allows kids to [master it].  So we're pushing envelope.  So the zip lining is great.  We've incorporated it this year on the 100-foot zip and that's opened the eyes to these kids and what they wanna do further.  And so now we wanna incorporate it further.  [We'll go further] always with the safety aspect in mind first.  So now looking at the zip line going 400 feet down across the valley.  And while that's all well and good, that's just a piece of the activity that we see and how we incorporate nature into that, the experience, and that's where the tree house came into play.
0:06:00;0:07:00;Daniel; When we talk about what's that tree house incorporate, it's how do we get kids up so that it's not just the zip line experience, it's the whole getting up and into the canopy of the tree to be a part of nature.  And what does that look like for a camper um prospectively?  So getting their ideas is important.  That's how we generate.  So when ideas come to me as, as one of the founders of the camp, I have first say, one, can it be done, and, two, can it be done safely.  Um, because one bad episode would [could close] my organization.  So I have to make sure that we're doing everything [coughing in background] on, on the safety first side before I expose it to any of the kids.  So that's kind of where it's been.  Um, we identified the current location last year, ah, as the starting point for a zip line because, one, it's [proximity in where we build it], but also it's a short run, but it's a good run [kind of issue], and now we're, we're ready to look beyond that.  And where that -
0:07:00;0:08:00;Daniel; point is, overlooks the lake and it's just an ideal place.  There's great mature trees.  Um, there's just a, a bevy of activity opportunities in that especially if we incorporate the zip line platform into the tree house itself.  From a vision perspective, we really looked at - camps has   trees, trees will continue to grow and trees will continue to die [screaming in background], so our hope is to construct a tree house that's built on, on, on a non-tree structure, but incorporating the tree into the tree house, so you're not damaging the trees, and incorporating it into the field of nature.  So it'd be on telephone poles or kinda like the zip line [construction].  Um, this is big vision right now.  And it's, um, those of you who know Dr. Chuck --, he and I go back 20-plus years, and the benefit of having a, a physician is who's willing to, to think globally [screaming in background] allows me to challenge your thoughts and how we can make these things happen.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Daniel; Um, and, and that's, that's enabled Champ Camp to become what it is today because we don't put limitations on what these kids [want to do].  Um, people put limitations on [on them].  I try to, I try to move around those limitation as best we can, and that's what you're here [unintelligible].
0:08:00;0:09:00;none;[Video cuts out briefly and comes back in 0:08:20 - different angle due to camera failure]
0:08:00;0:09:00;Daniel; Yeah, there's a lot to be seen there.  I mean there's active eagles over that [rail], that they'll see.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Tyler; I mean the nest is directly across from that spot.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Samuel; One thing that you definitely wanna do is cut out through that way and something maybe that looks a little higher too.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Tyler; You had spoken about [holding shed, a term you used - unintelligible ].
0:08:00;0:09:00;Matt; Maybe [a view shed], ah -
0:08:00;0:09:00;Tyler; Okay.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Catherine; Within the tree -
0:08:00;0:09:00;Daniel; Within the canopy of the tree.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Tyler; Yeah.
0:08:00;0:09:00;Samuel; Um, a-, actually, Matt, if you could just kind of explain to us -
0:09:00;0:10:00;Samuel; exactly what your function is, maybe that will help us kind of direct better questions to you.
0:09:00;0:10:00;Matt; Sure, um, start off - I'm a Purdue grad.  [Applause] Um, my title is director of landscape architecture, so, um  for the ah, staff of people.  Um, we manage all the construction and innovation projects for the university, across the state.  [Screaming in background]  Some projects we handle in-house we design these others we're managing and consulting on your architecture [unintelligible].  Um, and we've done quite a bit in here in the last five years or so including [the sports pavilion which is two years old now].  Um, typically, this camp will contact me and say, 'We have this project we want to do.  How do we go about getting it accomplished?'  Um, that's when I decide our staff will handle this do the -
0:10:00;0:11:00;Matt; - design in-house, or if it's big enough that we need some outside help we call up XYZ consultants and bring them in to work on it.  Um, and then I either oversee my own staff's production plans or development plans [how to do that] or code compliance, um, design compliance, um, pretty high aesthetic standard.  Um, it may vary at different campuses.  It varies here.  Um, camp location and we want to feel like we are in the woods.  Um, we construct things differently here.  Um, tree protection is critically important to us, um, in whatever we're doing on any of our campuses, but especially here in the woods.  Um, we're very selective about tree removal.  Um, so just a minute ago we were talking about selectively removing some trees, um, that would be very selectively   we wouldn't think - have too much reservation about removing, ah -
0:11:00;0:12:00;Matt; undergrowth   some scrub growth at this time of year, especially if it blocks your views down to the water flow.  But we start talking about 10-, 12-, and 30-inch trees., um, probably gonna look to another solution and find a better, better place where we can get a view.  Um, but I will say, um, there are really striking views there and there are some great possibilities there that give the sense of almost, ah, an overlook, similar to some of these others that you have up on the bluff.  Um, its, its variance, um, with good design you may be able to integrate that with a resting interval, uh get up halfway and then you push out, um, and then you go back up to go on up to what would be the, the larger tree house space.  Um, this is what I do day in and day out.  Um, talk to designers and dream up solutions, whether it's huge [loud voice in background] [landscapes] or, um, sports facilities or it's-
0:12:00;0:13:00;Matt; a lotta fun to come to into the woods and change gears and do things differently.  If it's site design, and it goes through my office [unintelligible].
0:12:00;0:13:00;Daniel; So we really envisioned the tree house to be a multipurpose, but almost a loading area for the zip line. It's kind of where that decision was made [unintelligible] with the plan [to take the] zip line [here, seen as if] you have seen the zip line platform [if you're] standing on that platform and hope to launch to your right across the valley is what our hope is, that will then end up in the [Charlotte -].
0:12:00;0:13:00;Tyler; [Charlotte, uh Baxter building].
0:12:00;0:13:00;Daniel; [Baxter building].  Um, so really incorporating the tree house as a staging area, one, but coupled [and, you're gonna hear some of the kids say, you know when you] zip line out of the tree house.  That's, -
0:13:00;0:14:00;Tyler; that's really the vision [hence] to make it a multi, multipurpose [middle-line] tree house as well.  Um, so that can really be envisioned, and that, that's gonna take some work to get through that valley.  [unintelligible].  That's what we're hoping for.  And that would be, you know, those - a certain amount of just functionality with the zip line, um, in terms of, you know, it's gotta be open.  You've got the cable above you.  Um, basically, if you're in a chair or what we call like [a booty] bag or sling, um, you've got the open [right ahead of you but if you want to] switch gears and we're not running the zip line and we want it to be a tree house, then there have got to be some type of security, like a gate, something like that, that closes, which also secures us.  Um, if you guys have seen some of our challenge courses, we have to have access prevention devices, um, which keeps people from just coming in off the street and climbing on our tower or getting up to a
0:14:00;0:15:00;Tyler; zip line and things like that. So for something like this where we want the tree house to be open and accessible, we would have to be able to - for one safety purposes for, for kids that are up there, close off that opening when we're not running it, um, but, two, also for that access prevention.
0:14:00;0:15:00;Catherine; Are you guys planning on doing the tree house [screaming in background] design in your office or, or [call someone else for that]?
0:14:00;0:15:00;Matt; I don't know that we know yet.
0:14:00;0:15:00;Catherine; Okay.  Okay.  May be depends how good these guys are -
0:14:00;0:15:00;Matt; [Unintelligible]
0:14:00;0:15:00;Matt; There will be significant structural concerns.  Um, and it may be that if we talk about ten kids potentially in power chairs -
0:15:00;0:16:00;Matt; they have some weight. And we may need to integrate steel in the structure.  Um, the, work with the structural engineer will know [unintelligible] to design that part.  It needs to be heavy-duty [screaming in background] construction   solid and safe.  That may even go back to elevated portion of ramp may need - strong - safe   that would help design what weight support at each level.
0:15:00;0:16:00;Carrie; I have a question for you, Tyler.
0:15:00;0:16:00;Tyler; Yeah.
0:15:00;0:16:00;Carrie; So I've heard a few like counselors say you guys have like an observation deck.  And like a lot of the kids were telling me like they wanted just like deck where they could sit on.  So how come you guys don't use your observation decks for that?
0:15:00;0:16:00;Tyler; Are they talking about the overlook -?
0:15:00;0:16:00;Carrie; I don't know what they're talking about.
0:15:00;0:16:00;Tyler; - down here?  I wonder if that's what -
0:16:00;0:17:00;Tyler; they're talking about.  So if you go - and you guys can check it out if you want.  Um, this main trail that runs through camp, so it goes right by the tro-, what we call the camper's pit up here that runs down, um, behind the amphitheater, and then goes to the switch backs, all the way down to the lake.  I think they're probably talking about that, which is there is one spot there where you come to a switch back, and it comes back, and there's a deck up there that overlooks the lake really pretty.  It's called [sounds like “Tulley'] Overlook.  Um, they do use that some.  I mean that's the spot that, that campers can go hang out sometimes.  Um, it may be not as central to some of what they're doing.  Ah, and I think Matt was saying, you know, potentially, maybe before you even get to the tree house there's a resting area or something like that as the ramp starts.  'Cause that, that ramp's gonna be pretty long to gain that amount of elevation.  Um, maybe that coincides with one of the areas where we, we go for that view a little bit.  Um, and then you could use that view without necessarily using the tree house as well.
0:17:00;0:18:00;Samuel; And she was saying that you start there kind of like where the current zip line ends.  And then by the time you got to where it begins [screaming in background] it would be about halfway up that zip line tower, and then you'd continue on from there.
0:17:00;0:18:00;none;[Video cuts out abruptly and comes back at 0:17:24 - second camera failure.]
0:17:00;0:18:00;Janice; What activities can be done inside the tree house as well as the kids are waiting.  And they did have an hour or two in their activity time in there.
0:17:00;0:18:00;Daniel; Yeah, like any, any of our programming we, we call [that the virtual line activity], um, because kids have to wait for the, the equipment is intensive so there's a lot of wait time.  Typically, it's pretty common, at least in our activities where we do, ah, some type of arts or arts and crafts.  So we, we modify it everywhere, so it's either, ah, [unintelligible] -
0:18:00;0:19:00;Daniel; from making, making mobile art or some areas of wheelchair art and there's a whole, whole litany of [unintelligible].  As long as we can incorporate it [back in] so they need see some type of activity like that.  Um, you're in the trees, and so it's an opportunity to do some type of observation, binoculars or you know, nature, nature component.  You could put feeders out there so you could see [birds, you could put] seed.
0:18:00;0:19:00;Janice; Mm-hmm.
0:18:00;0:19:00;Daniel; So there are those types of things to do to incorporate.  Um, you know, there's always - there's been dialogue even for some campers who want to see the stars.  Now depending on how high - how much of canopy is over this is how we incorporate that into a stargazing.  It's not as ideal as being out in the field, obviously.  Um, just, again, I go back to the kids, they're in an environment, where they are now out in the -
0:19:00;0:20:00;Daniel; so sky is something that's important.  So I  .  So they have big dreams and visions about what they wanna do.  The reality is that - how   how could it be done.  What, what does that - what does it allow 'em to do.  I personally don't see it being a, ah, playground type of a tree house.  Um, playgrounds are accessible.  Playgrounds are available in the parks that they have access to.  So I, I really lean towards more of the camp experience versus the like - and there are some camps who incorporate playgrounds into their programming Bradford Woods is not one that does that.  There are other that they do and that's not what we are looking for to entertain our camper.  It is more of a camp nature.
0:19:00;0:20:00;Tyler; [Screaming in background] I think part of is it's gonna be an improvement.  We ran the zip line for the first time
0:20:00;0:21:00;Tyler; a few weeks ago. Right now, they have to sit down at the bottom of the zip line waiting to get geared up and before they can go up there and so [very loud machinery in background], one, the ramp to get up there [unintelligible] which you kinda saw is a big flat black swinger arm and [four to one] pulley system to get them up to the top.  So, the ramp would obviously improve that.  I think like you said, just the novelty and the, the uniqueness factor of being up in the trees, um, can be something in and of itself for that.
0:20:00;0:21:00;Daniel; Yeah, and, and then even incorporating the zip line because these kids, all campers like to see their friends go.
0:20:00;0:21:00;Tyler; Yeah.
0:20:00;0:21:00;Daniel; And it's that first push off the platform where it's like, 'Okay.  I'm trusting that I'm gonna make it.'  Um, right now, they don't get that experience.  They see them, they see the expression of the kid when they land, but it's that -
0:21:00;0:22:00;Daniel; that descent is -
0:21:00;0:22:00;Tyler; And, and to be with them and offer encouragement and -
0:21:00;0:22:00;Daniel; Absolutely.
0:21:00;0:22:00;Tyler; - you know the kids are up there when we ran it a few weeks ago, by themselves.
0:21:00;0:22:00;Daniel; Right.
0:21:00;0:22:00;Tyler; No one else - I mean Daniel was up there and one of our facilitators was up there hooking them up, but, um, there's no moral support up there with them in terms of maybe they've got a buddy or a counselor that they're particularly close to who could encourage them in that if they are feeling nervous.
0:21:00;0:22:00;Mary; I have a question for you guys.  Um, so in terms of like - well, like   what exactly would you like the most useful thing we can give to you to like to use?  Like do you, do you want an actual like kind of undeveloped design that's kind of like rough?  Do you want a list of ideas or things that we think would be great to incorporate?  I mean what is gonna be most useful to you in terms of, of making this real?
0:22:00;0:23:00;Daniel; I could say yes to all the above.
0:22:00;0:23:00;Tyler; - yeah.  You know, obviously, there's, there's some sense of, you know, not doing the finished design as Matt was talking about, obviously, there's weight considerations structural stuff that needs to be gone through.  Um, by all means, rough designs or designs plural [loud machinery in background] that incorporate some of the ideas I was hoping you guys could add, and in terms of the kids have had. Some of the kids have had are awesome.
0:22:00;0:23:00;Matt; This is a big great space so design elements whether particularly interesting or innovative that [screaming in background] you might be able to dream up to we may not think of or the designers may not think of, um specifically with assisting these kids that, um, might not be common sense to us with creating lot of design over and over, but this is something unique that you can-
0:23:00;0:24:00;Matt; wrap your minds around.  But as far as getting into the, you know, the detail design or structural [unintelligible] or spatial relationships, um, [it could be generalizable].
0:23:00;0:24:00;Catherine; And none of us have that expertise.  We have one key [unintelligible], and that's it.  The TA.  [Engine starts in background]  [But most of us are not even - unintelligible].
0:23:00;0:24:00;Tyler; Yeah, but obviously, you know -
0:23:00;0:24:00;Catherine; Right.
0:23:00;0:24:00;Tyler; - it's not, it's not a totally -
0:23:00;0:24:00;Catherine; Yeah.
0:23:00;0:24:00;Tyler; - unrealistic conception [to sketch either] because you guys, you know, the existing trees and the platforms [up there now, so], you know, some really [unintelligible] -
0:23:00;0:24:00;Catherine; Oh, we just recognize our limitations [unintelligible].
0:23:00;0:24:00;Tyler; Yeah.
0:23:00;0:24:00;Daniel; And I would incorporate some of the things that the kids brought to [screaming in background] the table, think interactive.  These, these kids, they want things to be interactive, not - they don't want me doing something for them all the time.  If there's a way for them to incorporate what that is in their ideas.  Um -
0:24:00;0:25:00;Daniel; and it can be fun stuff.  You know, they, they talked about water, so now incorporating water into this.  What does that mean? You know, is it squirt gun, is it, laser?  Somebody said [screaming in background] a water slide like, 'Okay, that's, that's pretty extreme.'
0:24:00;0:25:00;Catherine; Hot tub.  [Crosstalk] Lot of hot tubs.
0:24:00;0:25:00;Daniel; So, as you kinda meld those thoughts, think about interactive kinda components and how that play in there.  That's, that's generalities.  We'll work on the scope of, of what it's gonna have to incorporate from a structural perspective with the interactive is the   the nuts and bolts of that, and Matt, his designers won't think about, 'cause that's not what they typically [unintelligible].
0:24:00;0:25:00;Tyler; One thing I think a couple of you guys have touched on is what are options for the ramp, too, and looking up those requirements that we could remember off the top of our head.  But, you know, the rise over the
0:25:00;0:26:00;Tyler; landing as everything. What are the options?  You know, a square going up around it work?  Does starting it, you know - talked about the - Shay mentioned the possibility of starting it way out and building it up over a long straightaway.  In terms of getting to the right height there and the topography that we're dealing with, what are the, what are the outcomes?
0:25:00;0:26:00;Matt; It's going to be a very long run.  Just -
0:25:00;0:26:00;Tyler; Yeah.
0:25:00;0:26:00;Matt; - for a frame of reference, look behind you at the entrance to the administration building, um, that's 18 inches up.  Ah, but you need that much ramp to be accessible.  Um, so when we're talking about the heights of the ramp.  You're gonna use most of that length from the landing zone all the way up  .
0:25:00;0:26:00;Janice; I was at a meeting last night with the board of directors and from a funding perspective as you guys are creating - been creating and dreaming big, we like that.  They like the fact that our next phase is gonna be the zip line.  We feel like that's a little bit more of a fixed cost  -
0:26:00;0:27:00;Janice; we can really put a number on that and say, 'This is what the 350-foot zip line is gonna cost.'  They like the fact that now we have this open-ended next phase at the end of that, because as we're raising money continuing to raise money, as your ideas and these ideas come together, that really allows us to go out and sell this to the funders, um, and saying, 'These - this is what we're trying to do' so we can get that next zip line done, and then now this, you know, we've - it's creative and let's go out and raise whatever, you know, he said - it is an issue.  You know?  We wish it wasn't.  But, um, dream big because that gives us something as we're going out and raising that money, um, to go with.  So the board is very excited about this creative [approach to the] tree house aspect. [Loud engine noise]
0:26:00;0:27:00;Emma; In terms, of, um, safety, I'm just thinking about this ramp, it sounds like it's gonna need to be over a 100 yards.  It's gonna be really long.  So -
0:27:00;0:28:00;Emma; we have this really long entryway.  In terms of safety, is there a concern if the child would need to be evacuated from the tree house quickly - there needed to be quick route out that's not that really long ramp?
0:27:00;0:28:00;Tyler; The zip line.
0:27:00;0:28:00;Emma; Is that - [Crosstalk] - I can't make a call if that's acceptable.  [Laughter]
0:27:00;0:28:00;Matt; I think the first thing with that's gonna impact the width, um, 'cause we wanna make sure that, that the turnaround and pass another wheelchair, um, without having to back up to [background noise].  And all that adds to cost that we are much wider.  So, um, as far as an express route out, I don't know that there's a better option in terms of [turnaround - unintelligible] accessibility.
0:27:00;0:28:00;Tyler; The higher lift can still be there, too.  It can still be an option for up and down as needed to be.
0:28:00;0:29:00;Daniel; And frankly I think it is less of a concern than you may perceive it to be.
0:28:00;0:29:00;Emma; Sure.
0:28:00;0:29:00;Daniel; Um, the maj-, the majority of the campers are gonna be with people [unintelligible].  Our campers will have all the emergency equipment they need right there.  So if there's anything that happens, we can address it wherever they are.  Accessibility to EMS , and I think we'll   we do - you do that now.  That's the   be caution - cautious with that, but it's in my eyes, that's, that's a low, low priority.
0:28:00;0:29:00;Emma; Sure.
0:28:00;0:29:00;Matt; One approach to that may be, though, accommodating able-bodied people, um.  It might be that similar to what you do at a main entrance.  The ramp is primary, but you also have another route that might be steps or, or a steeper ramp that's sort of the, the express route for accommodating people from two different, um, paths.  That may not be out of the question at all to have some steps or, or extra-steep -
0:29:00;0:30:00;Matt; ramping from multiple places or at least a single location.  Um, one of those funnel out or uh, the staff that's actually working at the zip line to get up and down quickly.
0:29:00;0:30:00;Daniel; I like that idea.  Type of stairs or [unintelligible].  [Screaming in background]
0:29:00;0:30:00;Samuel; One thing we were also thinking about as well is electricity   and when we were initially talking about this before we came down, we were kind of saying about these are the different things we could do with electricity in terms of, things that we can think about it.  So is there electricity in this sports complex , okay, and how feasible would it be to get electricity from there to the tree house location?
0:29:00;0:30:00;Tyler; I, I mean I think that's a - sounds like that's a given.  We'll make, we'll make that work.  That'll be part of it.
0:29:00;0:30:00;Matt; It only takes money.  [Laughter] It can be done.
0:30:00;0:31:00;Tyler; Yeah, I mean luckily it's not a huge run.  It's -
0:30:00;0:31:00;Matt; Right.
0:30:00;0:31:00;Tyler; - already there at the sport pavilion.
0:30:00;0:31:00;Samuel; Okay.  So I, I mean but like would it be something that's permanent, or just something that's there for the campers who must have electricity?
0:30:00;0:31:00;Daniel; It, it'd be permanent.
0:30:00;0:31:00;Tyler; Out, outlets and lights in the tree house it sounds like.
0:30:00;0:31:00;Matt; Lighting was brought up earlier.  Um, we wanna be intentional with that.  Um, what you don't wanna do is compete with these kids' experience of seeing stars when they're not typically accustomed to it, and everyone's experiencing deep in the woods like this.  Um, typical path lights and down lights, rather than illuminating the entire area, um, that's a little bit foreign to, you typically you want facial recognition and you're trying to get the light at that level.  Um, but probably lighting where they're stepping in this case.
0:30:00;0:31:00;Catherine; Well, somebody mentioned the lighting in the night at dark.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Tyler; That could, that could be possible.  You'd have a, you'd have to have a one -
0:31:00;0:32:00;none;[Video cuts out and comes back in 0:31:06]
0:31:00;0:32:00;June; Would we be able to see the treehouse and all of this when it is completed?
0:31:00;0:32:00;Daniel; Would you be able to?
0:31:00;0:32:00;June; Would we be able to like come back.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Daniel; Oh, yeah.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Janice; Absolutely.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Catherine; One hundred percent.
0:31:00;0:32:00;June; I, I would like to do that.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Tyler; Yeah, absolutely.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Richard; Matt, you had mentioned, ah, selected tree removal.  Um, there seems to be a lot of trees and what looks like the building area for the tree house.  Would we, ah, one, could we build around those and include those as part of the tree house?  Is that - that was an idea that kinda floated around a little bit, or would we have to remove those?
0:31:00;0:32:00;Matt; We'd have to look creatively at one of those.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Richard; Okay.
0:31:00;0:32:00;Matt; It's a great design feature when we're able to build around a tree and have it right -
0:32:00;0:33:00;Matt; in the structure [unintelligible] be very cautious about fall hazards and how to protect that zone where the trunk comes through.  Um, it can be done in a design challenge.
0:32:00;0:33:00;Richard; Okay.
0:32:00;0:33:00;Samuel; How do you plan for tree growth?  That's one
0:32:00;0:33:00;Matt; You just need to.  You need to know that it'll grow, yeah.
0:32:00;0:33:00;Samuel; Well, I mean that's one thing I was concerned with 'cause like it's, it's supposed to be a protected area.  When it rains, you don't want rain to get inside of the tree house, especially if there's electricity in the tree house.  So I don't know how we would  .
0:32:00;0:33:00;Matt; Typically, you could put your conduit, your electric lines in a conduit and use watertight fixtures, half light things you can integrate.  Um, so a lot of that can be exposed.  I think that's an open question, though, about just how enclosed [background noise] the tree house is gonna be, the experience, the open sky, um -
0:33:00;0:34:00;Samuel; You were talking about [unintelligible] roof material [unintelligible].
0:33:00;0:34:00;Female; Putting in skylights?
0:33:00;0:34:00;Samuel; Yeah skylights [opposable unintelligible].
0:33:00;0:34:00;Tyler; But, yeah, don't, don't - you guys don't have to get locked into the idea that it's a totally roofed-in structure like this.  Maybe there is a hole where the tree could.  It's open-ended right now.  Maybe part of it's like this and part of it's [more real].  I don't know.
0:33:00;0:34:00;Janice; And as you can tell, we're kind of in the development -
0:34:00;0:35:00;Janice; phase as well from an idea standpoint, so we - Daniel and Nancy and I have to our [um, have] visited the camp there in October last year, and that's when this whole process started generating then.  And, obviously, working with you and making sure we had what we needed to continue to go through this process.  Really, it was an accomplishment.  I think the zip line was - started to be built on a Tuesday, our camper - or our staff came in on Friday, which is the day it was completed.  Our campers came in on Sunday, and we were zip lining that next week, so that was just built right before our campers got here.  So we've like, were so excited that first day it was done.  And so we really hadn't got a lot beyond that.  We were just so focused on making sure that was up.  So now this is where we're really starting to generate the ideas for the future phases.  So we're kinda - you guys are right on the we're right here together going through this process.
0:35:00;0:36:00;Matt; I think it'd be ah useful for you to dream up design features.  What, what's inside of this tree house that needs to be a draw that makes these kids wanna be in that space and [some utility for them from that perspective]?  One thing I don't think we've been able to afford is [screaming in background] for this project, your nice outdoor fireplace of some sort, or the fire experience.  Some place where there can just be a, a fire ring like you have in, in a number of places.  It's very expensive, but in this case, since this - would that be a really exciting feature.  And then is that worth the number of dollars it would take for the masonry and construction ah involved.  Um, always balancing those two things.  But, ah, just thinking in terms of wow factors.  What's up there to make these kids, you know, experience something they aren't going to [somewhere else].
0:36:00;0:37:00;Janice; Like they said for our kids, the Champ Camp is the only camp that will accept the type of children that we have.  So this is their one and only shot at a camp experience, really.  Some kids [unintelligible] some of our kids can only come to ours.  So we really try to get them every thing that we can [unintelligible] every experience that they have has to last [for a year] until they come back [next year, so].  [unintelligible].
0:36:00;0:37:00;Mary; So you said you want it to stand like away from like the, like anything that's like having to do with playground, or you wanted it more like rustic camping?
0:36:00;0:37:00;Daniel; That's just Daniel's preference, you know.
0:36:00;0:37:00;Mary; 'Cause, ah, one of the things we were talking about is having maybe like since it's gonna be multilevel, maybe having like a slide that comes out one side and goes into another side, as like getting from one level to another and having like a clear top,-
0:37:00;0:38:00;Mary; so they can explain [screaming in background] [unintelligible].
0:37:00;0:38:00;Daniel; I think that's cool.
0:37:00;0:38:00;Mary; [Background noise] And then, um, I was talking to one of those - the staff members and they thought it would be really cool if we could come up with an inventive way [unintelligible] [engine starts up] a lot of people that are in wheelchairs [or have facilities] haven't had a chance to ever [expose] that kinda thing.
0:37:00;0:38:00;Catherine; What was that that you said?
0:37:00;0:38:00;Mary; A tire swing.
0:37:00;0:38:00;Catherine; Oh, a tire swing.
0:37:00;0:38:00;Carrie; [unintelligible] they could use their arms to wrap themselves to hold on [unintelligible].
0:37:00;0:38:00;Daniel; Um, yeah.  One of our board of directors wants - would like a swing incorporated.  And it's uh, not quite a tire swing, but it's, about, like the amusement parks that have that big boat that sways back and forth.
0:37:00;0:38:00;Group; Oh, yeah.
0:37:00;0:38:00;Daniel; Um, they'd design that.  Now I look, I look at that thing [that's a huge OSHA  issue], but, um, it can be done where you can strap in wheelchairs,-
0:38:00;0:39:00;Daniel; and have also seats back.  I'd incorporate that into it, so then - that's the one we've seen that's been made that came with it and it's got a couple kids in wheelchairs, it's really - it's manually generated versus something that gets it going.  So that's a dream of one of the board members is to have a swing concept be, what it is.  So I would say absolutely.  'Cause you're right, these kids don't - that's something they don't get either.  And chairs are easy to tie down.  I mean those - you make it.  It doesn't even require - think about the kids - even the kids that were here, um, they're pretty stable in their chairs.  You take 'em out of that chair, and put 'em on a tire, for example, a lot of 'em don't have trunk control or upper body control.  Where a wheelchair, you can get the same sensation by being in the wheelchair if you create, if you create the swing that adapts to the chair.
0:39:00;0:40:00;Catherine; Would it be possible to just see the chair you use for the zip line?
0:39:00;0:40:00;Tyler; Yeah, I think it's in the, um, office or [unintelligible].
0:39:00;0:40:00;Catherine; Okay.  [Engine starts in background]  [Excessive background noise continuous]
0:39:00;0:40:00;Daniel; It's the prototype for a [unintelligible].  But it - that chair right now is, is usable for any of the kids who are here at, at camp today.  It accommodates our kids, but it needs a few more adaptations, but it's, it's 100 percent - I've been on it.  You all can sit in it and make it work.  [Background noise]  So as, as an executive of my team, my next question would be and so when can expect something back?
0:39:00;0:40:00;Janice; Good question.
0:40:00;0:41:00;Daniel; What kind of timeframe are you looking at on creating these ideas?
0:40:00;0:41:00;Mary; As far as our class goes, I think we have until Friday [unintelligible] Friday.  So, Friday [unintelligible].  [Background noise]
0:40:00;0:41:00;Richard; We have design review presentation that's scheduled for Thursday   Thursday night.  So I think at that time, probably still be fairly broad ideas, and then we have all the next week as well like she said, to work on finalizing some things.  So that's kinda the timeframe we're working with [unintelligible].
0:40:00;0:41:00;Daniel; Okay.
0:40:00;0:41:00;Richard; Ideally for this project [unintelligible].
0:40:00;0:41:00;Daniel; Well, we would, we would expect to be in perfect formation and ready to go!
0:40:00;0:41:00;Catherine; We'll start building in three weeks.

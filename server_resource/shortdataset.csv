0:09:00;0:10:00;Matt; Sure, um, start off - I'm a Purdue grad.  [Applause] Um, my title is director of landscape architecture, so, um  for the ah, staff of people.  Um, we manage all the construction and innovation projects for the university, across the state.  [Screaming in background]  Some projects we handle in-house we design these others we're managing and consulting on your architecture [unintelligible].  Um, and we've done quite a bit in here in the last five years or so including [the sports pavilion which is two years old now].  Um, typically, this camp will contact me and say, 'We have this project we want to do.  How do we go about getting it accomplished?'  Um, that's when I decide our staff will handle this do the -
0:10:00;0:11:00;Matt; - design in-house, or if it's big enough that we need some outside help we call up XYZ consultants and bring them in to work on it.  Um, and then I either oversee my own staff's production plans or development plans [how to do that] or code compliance, um, design compliance, um, pretty high aesthetic standard.  Um, it may vary at different campuses.  It varies here.  Um, camp location and we want to feel like we are in the woods.  Um, we construct things differently here.  Um, tree protection is critically important to us, um, in whatever we're doing on any of our campuses, but especially here in the woods.  Um, we're very selective about tree removal.  Um, so just a minute ago we were talking about selectively removing some trees, um, that would be very selectively   we wouldn't think - have too much reservation about removing, ah -
0:11:00;0:12:00;Matt; undergrowth   some scrub growth at this time of year, especially if it blocks your views down to the water flow.  But we start talking about 10-, 12-, and 30-inch trees., um, probably gonna look to another solution and find a better, better place where we can get a view.  Um, but I will say, um, there are really striking views there and there are some great possibilities there that give the sense of almost, ah, an overlook, similar to some of these others that you have up on the bluff.  Um, its, its variance, um, with good design you may be able to integrate that with a resting interval, uh get up halfway and then you push out, um, and then you go back up to go on up to what would be the, the larger tree house space.  Um, this is what I do day in and day out.  Um, talk to designers and dream up solutions, whether it's huge [loud voice in background] [landscapes] or, um, sports facilities or it's-
0:12:00;0:13:00;Matt; a lotta fun to come to into the woods and change gears and do things differently.  If it's site design, and it goes through my office [unintelligible].
0:12:00;0:13:00;Daniel; So we really envisioned the tree house to be a multipurpose, but almost a loading area for the zip line. It's kind of where that decision was made [unintelligible] with the plan [to take the] zip line [here, seen as if] you have seen the zip line platform [if you're] standing on that platform and hope to launch to your right across the valley is what our hope is, that will then end up in the [Charlotte -].
0:12:00;0:13:00;Tyler; [Charlotte, uh Baxter building].
0:12:00;0:13:00;Daniel; [Baxter building].  Um, so really incorporating the tree house as a staging area, one, but coupled [and, you're gonna hear some of the kids say, you know when you] zip line out of the tree house.  That's, -
0:13:00;0:14:00;Tyler; that's really the vision [hence] to make it a multi, multipurpose [middle-line] tree house as well.  Um, so that can really be envisioned, and that, that's gonna take some work to get through that valley.  [unintelligible].  That's what we're hoping for.  And that would be, you know, those - a certain amount of just functionality with the zip line, um, in terms of, you know, it's gotta be open.  You've got the cable above you.  Um, basically, if you're in a chair or what we call like [a booty] bag or sling, um, you've got the open [right ahead of you but if you want to] switch gears and we're not running the zip line and we want it to be a tree house, then there have got to be some type of security, like a gate, something like that, that closes, which also secures us.  Um, if you guys have seen some of our challenge courses, we have to have access prevention devices, um, which keeps people from just coming in off the street and climbing on our tower or getting up to a
0:14:00;0:15:00;Tyler; zip line and things like that. So for something like this where we want the tree house to be open and accessible, we would have to be able to - for one safety purposes for, for kids that are up there, close off that opening when we're not running it, um, but, two, also for that access prevention.
0:14:00;0:15:00;Catherine; Are you guys planning on doing the tree house [screaming in background] design in your office or, or [call someone else for that]?
